      <h2>Presentation</h2>
      <p>
        Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
        My name is Eyosias Abera. I am thrilled to join a vacant position as an English teacher/Internship position as a teacher. I am
        an enthusiastic candidate who can be counted on to completely participate in the role and grow professionally in an
        initiative-taking manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated from Kotebe Metropolitan University with a diploma in education with a 2.94 CGPA and have been working in
        different private schools as an English language teacher in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I also have a pending B.A degree with a 3.10
        CGPA in Educational Planning and Management, left with two courses from Admas University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Over
        the course of my career, I have developed proven youth and adult teaching methodology, management, and educational
        material designing skills, which I hope to leverage into the teaching/management role.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I have arrived in Sweden, I have been eager to continue my career with all the opportunities at my disposal. Hiring
        me, I believe, would be like adding an asset to your institution. I am excited to elaborate on how my specific skills and
        abilities will benefit your organization if given the opportunity. Thank you in advance.
      </p>
      <p>Sincerely,<br>
        Eyosias Abera
