          <p class="section__text__p1">Hi, I&rsquo;m Eyosias Mamo!</p>
          <p class="section__text__p2">I&rsquo;m passionate about web development, IT, and creating innovative solutions. With a strong background in education and IT support, I bring a unique blend of experience and skills to every project. I began my professional journey as a high school language teacher, where I honed my communication, organization, and problem-solving abilities over five years. Transitioning into the IT field, I pursued studies in IT Support Services and worked as an IT Support Technician for two years in a private hotel. There, I gained hands-on experience in maintaining computer systems, managing hardware and software, and troubleshooting technical issues.</p>
          <p>To deepen my technical expertise, I studied IT support and help desk operations with a specialization in Microsoft 365. I earned certifications in Microsoft 365 Fundamentals (MS-900) and Microsoft Security (SC-900), which enhanced my skills in modern workplace solutions and IT security.</p>
          <p>Currently, I am pursuing a full-stack .NET development program to expand my creativity and technical capabilities. My vision is to design and develop applications and websites that are not only functional but also impactful, scalable, and user-friendly. With a foundation in teaching, IT support, and now software development, I am driven to build intuitive digital experiences that make a meaningful difference, from small projects to large-scale solutions.</p>
